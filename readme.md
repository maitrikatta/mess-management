JAVAFX Project created with the help of SceneBuilder
This is java project created for/as a college assignment. not ready for production.
It has some known bugs.
It implements Derby Database, you need to download and configure.
The application is developed on Eclipse, so you better run there to get exact results.
Yet there is no SQL query file to make database, in future will try to push it.
